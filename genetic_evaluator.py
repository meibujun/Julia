Genetic Evaluation functions for the Sheep Breeding Management System.

This module provides functions for calculating relationship matrices,
setting up inputs for BLUP (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction) evaluations,
and outlines integration with genomic selection.

Placeholder for database connection:
Functions that interact with the database (e.g., fetching phenotypes or GEBVs)
are designed to take a `db_connection` object. However, for this subtask,
no actual database calls are made; these are conceptual integrations with
`data_manager.py`.

def calculate_additive_relationship_matrix(pedigree_data):

    Calculates the Additive Relationship Matrix (A) using the tabular method.

    The method requires animals to be ordered such that parents precede their offspring.

    Args:

                       None or 0 (or any other designated value) for unknown parents.
                       It's assumed this list can be processed to get a unique, ordered
                       set of animals.

## Advanced Genomic Selection Integration Notes:

The functions above provide basic pedigree-based EBV calculation. Modern genetic
evaluation often incorporates genomic data for higher accuracy (GEBVs - Genomic EBVs).
Integrating a comprehensive genomic selection module would involve:

1.  **Input Data:**
    *   **Genotypes:** High-density SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) data for a
        subset of animals, typically stored in the `GenomicData` table (linked to `Markers`).
        This data forms the Genomic Relationship Matrix (G).
    *   **Phenotypes:** As used in traditional BLUP, from `PhenotypicRecords`.
    *   **Pedigree:** Full pedigree from `Pedigrees` table to construct A matrix, especially
        for methods like ssGBLUP.

2.  **Methods for Calculating GEBVs:**
    *   **GBLUP (Genomic BLUP):** Similar to pedigree BLUP, but the A matrix (or A_inv)
        is replaced by a Genomic Relationship Matrix (G) (or G_inv) calculated from
        SNP markers. This is typically used for animals that are genotyped.
        MME: Z'Z + G_inv * lambda.
    *   **ssGBLUP (single-step GBLUP):** Combines pedigree and genomic information into a
        single analysis. It uses a combined relationship matrix (H_inv) that incorporates
        both A_inv and G_inv. This allows simultaneous evaluation of genotyped and
        non-genotyped animals, leveraging all available data.
        MME: Z'Z + H_inv * lambda. H_inv is constructed based on A_inv, G_inv, and
        the pedigree relationships between genotyped and non-genotyped animals.
    *   **Bayesian Methods (e.g., BayesA, BayesB, BayesC, BayesR):** These methods
        estimate marker effects directly, assuming different distributions for these effects.
        They can be computationally intensive but may offer advantages for certain
        genetic architectures.
    *   **SNP-BLUP / RR-BLUP (Ridge Regression BLUP):** Similar to GBLUP but explicitly estimates marker effects.

3.  **Process:**
    *   **Data Preparation:** Collect and clean phenotypes, pedigree, and genotypes.
        Quality control on SNP data is crucial (call rate, MAF, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium).
    *   **Matrix Construction:**
        *   Calculate G from SNP data.
        *   If ssGBLUP, calculate A_inv for the entire pedigree, G_inv for genotyped animals,
          then construct H_inv.
    *   **Model Fitting:** Solve the MME (for GBLUP/ssGBLUP) or run MCMC (for Bayesian methods)
        to estimate breeding values.
    *   **GEBV Calculation:** The solutions for animal effects are the GEBVs. For non-genotyped
        animals in ssGBLUP, their GEBVs are derived based on their pedigree relationship to
        genotyped animals.

4.  **Output and Usage:**
    *   GEBVs are generally more accurate than pedigree-based EBVs, especially for young
        animals with no or limited progeny, as they capture genetic merit directly from DNA.
    *   These GEBVs would be stored (e.g., in `GenomicData` table with a specific `GEBV_TraitID`)
        and used for selection decisions, mating plans, etc., potentially superseding
        traditional EBVs for genotyped animals or animals with strong genomic links.

5.  **Software/Tools:**
    *   Specialized software packages are often used for genomic evaluations (e.g., BLUPF90 family,
        ASReml, GCTA, PLINK for QC and G matrix). Implementing these from scratch is a
        significant undertaking. This module would typically interface with such tools or
        implement simplified versions of the core algorithms.
