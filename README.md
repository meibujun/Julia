# LLM-Powered Sheep Breeding Management System

## Introduction

The LLM-Powered Sheep Breeding Management System is a conceptual software project designed to revolutionize how sheep breeders manage their flocks, make informed breeding decisions, and interact with complex genetic data. Its core purpose is to provide a comprehensive suite of tools for data management, genetic evaluation, and mating planning, all accessible through both traditional user interfaces and an innovative Natural Language Processing (NLP) interface. This NLP-first approach aims to simplify complex queries and data entry, making advanced flock management accessible to a wider range of users.

The system leverages modern data management practices, established genetic evaluation principles (like BLUP), and outlines pathways for integrating advanced genomic selection techniques. By combining these powerful backend capabilities with an intuitive interaction model, it seeks to enhance breeding efficiency, genetic gain, and overall farm productivity.

## Core Features

*   **Comprehensive Animal Data Management:** Track individual animal details, pedigrees, and phenotypic records.
*   **Pedigree-Based Genetic Evaluation:** Implementation of BLUP (Best Linear Unbiased Prediction) framework using an additive relationship matrix (A matrix) for estimating breeding values (EBVs).
*   **Genomic Selection Outline:** Conceptual framework for integrating genomic data (SNPs) to calculate Genomic EBVs (GEBVs) using methods like GBLUP or ssGBLUP.
*   **Advanced Mating Plans:** Tools to suggest optimal mates based on user-defined selection criteria, expected progeny EBVs, and inbreeding coefficient limits.
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Interface:** A simulated conversational interface allowing users to manage data, ask questions, and request analyses using natural language commands.
*   **Modular Design:** Clearly defined backend modules for data management, genetic evaluation, and mating planning.
*   **API-Driven Architecture:** A documented API design to facilitate integration with potential frontend user interfaces (web or mobile).
*   **Conceptual UI Design:** Outlines for user interface elements and views for a graphical interaction alternative.

## System Architecture Overview

The system is conceptualized with a modular architecture:

1.  **Database:** The foundation, storing all data related to animals, traits, phenotypes, pedigrees, genomic information, users, and mating plans. The schema is detailed in `database_schema.md`.
2.  **Backend Modules (Python):**
    *   `data_manager.py`: Handles direct interactions with the database (CRUD operations for all core data entities).
    *   `genetic_evaluator.py`: Performs genetic evaluations, including calculating the relationship matrix (A), preparing inputs for BLUP, and (conceptually) solving MMEs to get EBVs. It also outlines genomic data integration.
    *   `mating_planner.py`: Provides tools for calculating expected inbreeding and progeny EBVs, and suggesting mates based on user criteria.
3.  **API Layer:** A RESTful API (detailed in `api_design.md`) exposes backend functionalities to client applications. This API acts as the intermediary between the frontend/NLP interface and the backend logic.
4.  **NLP Interface (`nlp_interface_designer.py`):** This conceptual module simulates how user natural language queries would be parsed into intents and entities. It then dispatches these to the appropriate backend functions (via the API layer in a full implementation) and formats the results back into a natural language response.
5.  **User Interface (UI) (Conceptual):** A graphical user interface (web or mobile, detailed in `ui_conceptualization.md`) would interact with the API to provide a visual way for users to manage data, view results, and configure processes. The NLP interface would be a key component of this UI.

In a full implementation, a user query (either via direct NLP input or a UI action translated into an NLP command/API call) would be processed by the NLP interface/API, routed to the relevant backend module(s), which interact with the database, and then a response would be formulated and sent back to the user.

## Modules/Components

### Python Modules (Backend Logic & NLP Simulation):

*   **`data_manager.py`:** Contains Python functions for all database interactions related to creating, reading, updating, and deleting records for animals, phenotypic data, traits, and pedigrees.
*   **`genetic_evaluator.py`:** Includes functions for calculating the additive relationship matrix (A), placeholders for preparing BLUP inputs, solving Mixed Model Equations (MME) for EBVs, and an outline for future genomic selection integration.
*   **`mating_planner.py`:** Provides functions to calculate expected inbreeding coefficients, estimate expected progeny EBVs, and suggest optimal mates based on user-defined criteria and constraints.
*   **`nlp_interface_designer.py`:** Simulates an NLP engine by parsing example natural language commands into intents and entities, and then dispatching conceptual actions to the backend modules, returning a simulated natural language response.

### Design Documents (Markdown):

*   **`database_schema.md`:** Details the structure of the database, including tables, columns, data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships.
*   **`api_design.md`:** Describes the RESTful API endpoints for frontend integration, including paths, HTTP methods, request/response formats, and error codes for all core functionalities.
*   **`ui_conceptualization.md`:** Outlines the conceptual design of user interface elements and views, describing their purpose, key information/controls, and interaction with the NLP system.
*   **`README.md` (this file):** Provides an overview of the project.
*   **`FUTURE_DEVELOPMENT.md`:** Discusses potential future enhancements and new features for the system.

## Setup and Usage (Conceptual)

If this system were to be fully implemented, the setup and usage would conceptually involve these steps:

1.  **Database Setup:**
    *   Choose a database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
    *   Apply the schema defined in `database_schema.md` to create tables and relationships.
    *   Optionally, populate with initial data (e.g., standard breed codes, trait definitions).
2.  **Backend Deployment:**
    *   Set up a Python environment with necessary libraries (e.g., for database connection, numerical computation like NumPy/SciPy, web framework for API like Flask/Django).
    *   Configure database connection details for `data_manager.py`.
    *   Deploy the backend modules and the API layer on a server.
3.  **LLM Integration (for NLP Interface):**
    *   Choose an LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI, Google AI, Hugging Face).
    *   Develop the `nlp_interface_designer.py` logic further to make actual API calls to the LLM for intent recognition and entity extraction from user queries, and for generating more dynamic natural language responses.
    *   Securely manage API keys.
4.  **Frontend Application Development:**
    *   Develop a web or mobile application based on `ui_conceptualization.md` that interacts with the backend via the documented API in `api_design.md`.
    *   Integrate the NLP input area as a primary interaction method.
5.  **User Interaction:**
    *   Users would access the system via the web/mobile UI.
    *   They could use the NLP input bar to issue commands like "Add new lamb L007...", "What are the best rams for ewe E012 considering fleece weight?", "Show weaning weights for lambs born last month."
    *   Alternatively, they could use structured forms and views for data entry, browsing, and initiating complex processes like mating suggestions.
    *   The system processes these requests, interacts with backend modules and the database, and returns information to the user either as natural language responses or updated UI views.

This conceptual project provides the design blueprint for such a system.
