# NLP Interface: Design and Conceptual Enhancements

## 1. Overview of Enhancements

The Natural Language Processing (NLP) interface of the Sheep Breeding Management System, simulated in `nlp_interface_designer.py`, has undergone significant conceptual enhancements. The primary goal of this revision was to move towards a more robust, flexible, and user-friendly conversational experience, laying a better groundwork for potential future integration with a true Large Language Model (LLM).

Key improvement areas include:

*   **Sophisticated Parsing Strategy:** A multi-stage approach to better understand user intent and extract more complex, structured information.
*   **Modular Entity Extraction:** Conceptualized helper functions for identifying and structuring diverse entities like conditions, date ranges, and aggregations.
*   **Structured Dispatch Logic:** Clearer mapping from parsed user goals to specific conceptual backend actions.
*   **Improved Response Generation:** Generating more informative, context-aware, and helpful system responses, including guidance for UI interaction.
*   **Basic Multi-Turn Conversation Handling:** Introducing a `session_context` to remember previous interactions and handle simple clarification dialogues and contextual follow-ups.

These enhancements aim to simulate a higher quality interaction, providing a clearer path for what a fully implemented NLP/LLM-driven interface should achieve.

## 2. Revised Parsing Strategy (`parse_command`)

The `parse_command` function was overhauled to adopt a multi-stage parsing approach, moving beyond simple keyword matching for intents.

### Multi-Stage Approach:

1.  **Initial Pass & Clarification Check:** The parser first checks if there's a pending clarification request from a previous turn. If so, it assumes the current input is a response to that clarification.
2.  **Primary Intent Identification:** Based on primary keywords (e.g., "list", "add", "run", "suggest", "these"), a broad `primary_intent` is identified. This categorizes the user's general goal.
3.  **Subject Analysis & Secondary Keywords:** Depending on the `primary_intent`, further analysis of keywords helps determine the main `subject` of the command (e.g., `animal`, `phenotype`, `ebv`).
4.  **Modular Entity Extraction:** Once the primary intent and subject are tentatively identified, conceptual helper functions (simulated with regular expressions) are invoked to extract relevant `entities`. These entities are more structured than in the previous version.
5.  **Ambiguity Detection:** Basic checks are performed to see if critical entities for an identified intent are missing. If so, an `ambiguity_info` field is populated.

### Primary Intents:

The system now recognizes the following primary intents:
*   `PI_QUERY_DATA`: For requests to retrieve or list information.
*   `PI_ADD_DATA`: For adding new records (animals, phenotypes).
*   `PI_UPDATE_DATA`: For modifying existing records.
*   `PI_DELETE_DATA`: For deactivating or removing records.
*   `PI_RUN_ANALYSIS`: For computational tasks like BLUP, inbreeding calculation, mate suggestions.
*   `PI_SYSTEM_COMMAND`: For system-level actions like defining new traits (conceptual).
*   `PI_CONTEXTUAL_FOLLOW_UP`: For commands that refer to previous results or context.
*   `PI_CLARIFICATION_RESPONSE`: When the user's input is an answer to a system's clarifying question.
*   `PI_UNKNOWN`: If the intent cannot be determined.

### Recognized Subject Types:

Based on keywords, the parser attempts to identify subjects like:
*   `SUBJ_ANIMAL`
*   `SUBJ_PHENOTYPE`
*   `SUBJ_EBV` / `SUBJ_GEBV`
*   `SUBJ_PEDIGREE`
*   `SUBJ_INBREEDING`
*   `SUBJ_MATES`
*   `SUBJ_BLUP_RUN`
*   `SUBJ_TRAIT`
*   `SUBJ_RELATIONSHIP_MATRIX`
*   `SUBJ_GENETIC_TREND`
*   `SUBJ_NONE` (if no specific subject or intent implies it)

### Targeted Entities and Structure:

The `entities` dictionary returned by the parser is now more structured:
*   **Animal Identifiers (`animal_ids`):** Lists of eartags/IDs.
*   **Trait Names (`trait_names`):** Lists of trait names.
*   **Dates and Date Ranges (`date_filters`):** Structured as `{'specific_dates': [], 'born_after_date': 'YYYY-MM-DD', ...}`.
*   **Numeric Values and Ranges:** Often captured within `conditions`.
*   **Conditions (`conditions`):** A list of dictionaries, each representing a filter criterion: `[{'field': 'BirthWeight', 'op': '>', 'value': 4.2}, {'field': 'Sex', 'op': '=', 'value': 'Female'}]`.
*   **Sorting Criteria (`sort_criteria`):** `{'field': 'birth_date', 'direction': 'DESC'}`.
*   **Aggregation Requests (`aggregations`):** `[{'func': 'AVG', 'field': 'WeaningWeight', 'group_by': 'Breed'}]`.
*   **Contextual Cues (`use_context_subject`, `requested_fields_for_context`):** Flags and information for handling follow-up commands.
*   **Raw Sub-Phrases for Complex Tasks:** For highly complex inputs like selection index components (`selection_criteria_raw`) or BLUP fixed effects (`fixed_effects`), the parser extracts the relevant raw string chunk, deferring detailed parsing to specialized backend logic (or a more powerful NLU).

### Ambiguity Information (`ambiguity_info`):
If the parser identifies an intent but critical entities are missing (e.g., trying to add an animal without an eartag), this field is populated, typically with `{'missing_entity': ['Eartag', ...]}`. This allows the dispatcher to formulate a clarifying question.

## 3. Enhanced Dispatch Logic (`dispatch_action`)

The `dispatch_action` function was revised to leverage the more structured output from the enhanced parser.

*   **Structured Input Processing:** It now directly uses `primary_intent`, `subject`, `entities`, and `ambiguity_info`.
*   **Mapping to Backend Actions:** A more organized `if/elif` structure based on `(primary_intent, subject)` combinations determines the conceptual backend action.
*   **Detailed Conceptual Calls:** The printouts describing the "Conceptual call" to backend modules are now more detailed, showing the structured entities that would be passed (e.g., `data_manager.list_animals(filters={'conditions': [{'field': 'Sex', ...}]})`).
*   **New Conceptual Backend Functions Implied:** The enhanced commands and their dispatching imply the need for more sophisticated backend functions than initially defined. For example:
    *   `data_manager.list_animals` would need to handle complex filtering based on multiple conditions, date ranges, and sorting.
    *   `data_manager.get_animal_aggregates` for count, average, etc.
    *   `genetic_evaluator.run_blup_evaluation` with detailed model parameters.
    *   `genetic_evaluator.compare_ebvs_for_animals`.
    *   `genetic_evaluator.get_genetic_trend`.
    *   `mating_planner.suggest_mates` would need to parse complex selection index strings and exclusion criteria.

## 4. Improved Response Generation

A key focus was to make the system's simulated responses more user-friendly and informative.

*   **Clarity and Confirmation:** For actions like adding or updating data, the system confirms what it's about to do or has done.
*   **Summaries for Queries:** For queries returning lists, the response might mention the number of results found. For aggregations, it states the calculated value.
*   **Graceful "No Results":** If a query yields no results (simulated), the system provides a clear "No animals/records found matching your criteria" type of message.
*   **Acknowledgement of Parameters:** Responses often acknowledge key filters or parameters used in the query (e.g., "Okay, searching for animals where Sex = Female and Breed = Merino...").
*   **UI Guidance:** When appropriate, responses suggest where the information would typically be displayed in a graphical UI, referencing concepts from `ui_conceptualization.md` (e.g., "Results would appear in 'Animal List View'"). This helps bridge the gap between NLP interaction and visual interfaces.
*   **Clarifying Questions:** If `ambiguity_info` is present, the dispatcher formulates a specific question to the user to obtain the missing information.
*   **Simulated Error Messages:** Placeholder messages for conceptual backend failures (though not deeply implemented in the simulation).

**Illustrative Examples:**

*   *Old Style:* "Animals matching criteria: L001, K030."
*   *New Style (Query):* "Okay, searching for animals where Sex = Female and Breed = Merino. Found 2 animals. (Results would appear in 'Animal List View')"
*   *New Style (Clarification):* "I can help add a new animal. What is the eartag for this animal?"
*   *New Style (Contextual):* "For the previously listed 3 animals, their sire IDs are: [simulated_data_list]. (This could update the 'Animal List View' or show a modal)"

## 5. Multi-Turn Conversation Handling

Basic multi-turn conversation capabilities were introduced using a global `session_context` dictionary.

*   **`session_context` Object:** This dictionary stores:
    *   `last_query_results`: Summary of the data from the last query (e.g., list of animal IDs, count, filters used).
    *   `last_subject_type`: The type of subject from the last interaction (e.g., `animal_list`, `animal_detail`).
    *   `last_filters_applied`: The filters used in the last query.
    *   `pending_clarification`: A dictionary storing details if the system has asked a clarifying question, including the original parsed command and what entity is expected.
    *   `user_preferences`: (Example) User-specific settings like date format.

*   **Conceptual Detection of Contextual Cues:** The `_parse_contextual_cues` helper function looks for simple anaphoric references (e.g., "these animals", "for those", "its EBVs"). If such cues are found, it flags `use_context_subject`.

*   **Dispatcher's Use of `session_context`:**
    *   **Applying Context:** If `parse_command` flags `use_context_subject`, `dispatch_action` attempts to use relevant data from `session_context` (e.g., using `last_query_results['ids']` as the target for a follow-up command like "show their sire IDs").
    *   **Updating Context:** After executing an action, `dispatch_action` updates `session_context` with relevant information from the current command (e.g., new `last_query_results`).
    *   **Managing Clarification Dialogues:**
        1.  If the parser flags ambiguity, `dispatch_action` formulates a question and stores the `original_parsed` command and `expected_entity` in `session_context['pending_clarification']`.
        2.  If the user's next input is identified by the parser as a `PI_CLARIFICATION_RESPONSE`, `dispatch_action` retrieves the pending clarification details.
        3.  It attempts to integrate the user's answer (the clarification) back into the `original_parsed` command's entities.
        4.  It then re-dispatches this amended command, effectively continuing the interrupted action.
        5.  The `pending_clarification` state is cleared once the clarification is processed or if a non-clarification command is received.

## 6. Scope and Limitations of the Simulation

It is crucial to reiterate that `nlp_interface_designer.py` is a **simulation**. It does not involve any actual Natural Language Understanding (NLU) or Large Language Models (LLMs).

*   **Regex-Based:** The parsing relies on regular expressions and keyword spotting. This is inherently brittle and cannot handle the vast diversity of natural language phrasing, synonyms, or complex grammatical structures that a true LLM could.
*   **Limited Semantic Understanding:** The system does not understand the *meaning* of the words beyond predefined patterns. It cannot infer implicit information or reason about the data.
*   **Novel Phrasing:** New ways of asking for the same thing will likely fail if they don't match existing regex patterns.
*   **Complex Reasoning & Multi-Step Logic:** The system cannot perform complex multi-step reasoning that isn't explicitly coded in the dispatcher. For example, "Find the best ram to improve wool quality for ewes that had difficult births last year" involves multiple stages of querying and evaluation that are beyond this simulation's scope.
*   **Context Handling is Basic:** The multi-turn context is limited to simple anaphora and direct clarification. It does not support broader conversational context or memory of distant past interactions.
*   **Error Handling:** Simulated error messages are basic; real-world error handling from backend systems would be more complex.

## 7. Guidance for Future LLM Integration

This enhanced simulation, despite its limitations, provides a valuable conceptual blueprint for integrating a real LLM:

*   **Intents and Subjects as Targets:** The defined `primary_intent` and `subject` categories can serve as a target schema for what the LLM should identify from user input.
*   **Structured Entity Extraction:** The structured `entities` dictionary (with conditions, date ranges, aggregations, etc.) represents the desired output format from an LLM's entity extraction phase. This structured data is much easier for backend systems to consume than raw text.
*   **Function Calling/Tool Usage:** Modern LLMs support "function calling" or "tool usage" where the LLM can be instructed to output a JSON object matching a predefined schema based on the user's query. The structure of `parsed_output` (intent, subject, entities) in this simulation is a good candidate for such a schema.
*   **Context Management:** The `session_context` concept, while basic here, highlights the need for robust session and context management when working with LLMs to enable coherent multi-turn conversations. LLM APIs often provide mechanisms for passing conversation history.
*   **Prompt Engineering:** The example commands in `enhanced_nlp_commands.txt` and the parsing logic can inform prompt engineering efforts. Prompts would instruct the LLM on the types of tasks, the desired output format, and how to handle ambiguity or requests for clarification.
*   **Clarification Loop:** The simulated clarification dialogue can be directly translated into an LLM interaction pattern: if the LLM's output lacks confidence or necessary entities, the application layer can prompt the LLM to ask the user a clarifying question.

By designing a more sophisticated simulation with structured inputs and outputs for the NLP component, this revision makes the conceptual leap to a real LLM-powered system clearer and more planned.
